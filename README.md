# Password-Generator
An application to generate a random password

## Descritption
This project is an application to generate a random password for an employee. This project was built to become familiar with prompts, functions and objects in javascript. During the course of this project the importance of data types, problem solving and functions was fully understood to achieve the desired functionality of the webpage.

## This project completed the following:  
* When the 'Generate password' button is clicked
  * A series of prompts for password criteria is presented to the user
    * Length of password
      * At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters 
  * Code validates for input of character length of password. If the password length is within 8-128 characters the next prompt is called.
  * Code validates for input of the character types. If at least one character is chosen by the user then the password will be generated.
  * Once the prompts are answered, meeting the above criteria, the password should be generated and displayed written to the page
